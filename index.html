          <p>A graphic designer is a professional who creates visual concepts, using digital tools (or traditionally by hand), to express ideas in art from that inspire, inform, please or captivate people, primarily consumers.

            The visual expressions could be related to print, website designing, advertising, games, magazines, or creation of brand identity.

          <p>Out of all the advantages of digital marketing, brand awareness is the most significant, especially for newly established businesses. In fact, social media marketing helps businesses promote their products on various digital platforms, such as Instagram and LinkedIn, and collaborate with other brands to increase awareness. Moreover, SEO helps businesses rank higher on search engines, leading to increased brand awareness and visibility.

          <div class="topic">Icon Design</div>
          <p>Types of Icons
            Glyph icons: These are symbols and are frequently solid. They can be scaled to whichever size you want and can be customized with different colors and shadow effects. Because they are generally a solid color, icons can work really well at small sizes, but may not behave as required at larger sizes.
            Colored icons: These icons have color. They can either have a solid color or a gradient color scheme. The drawback of colored icons is that they can be more challenging to integrate into UI and can even distract users from the main content.
            Universal icons: These icons are noticed instantly, and usually represent repetitive actions. Universal actions in any product should be depicted with universal icons to avoid any chaos.
            Unique icons: They represent unique features. The drawback of using them is that they are very hard for first-time users to understand. So, make sure that you include text labels when you use them.</p>

            Documentation and Communication: Photos are powerful tools for documenting events, conveying messages, and communicating ideas effectively.
